# Amazon-Review-Analysis
The notebook contains a comprehensive study on Amazon Review Analysis and Classification which serves as my CIS545 final project!
It is a highly readable notebook that clearly lays out the roadmap of the analysis process. The main training set is the text from 100,000 reviews from Amazon, and their star ratings. 
The goal is to use the textual data to predict the star ratings, and to further explore and evaluate different methods to determine the best performing model for this task.
